# ðŸ“Š Prompt playground 

**Test your prompts with various models and configurations**

Prompt engineering is iterative process. This app streamlines the loop by providing instant feedback and enabling live experimentation, useful for both quick prototyping and deeper analysis.

You can experiment with different settings and run prompts on multiple models at once to see differences in output, helping you craft the perfect prompt for your specific needs.

You can use Prompt Playground live at https://prompt-playground-app.streamlit.app/

## ðŸ”§ Features
- **Run prompts across multiple LLMs simultaneously** â€“ Compare how different models interpret and respond to the same input.
- **Experiment with model settings** â€“ Tweak parameters like temperature, max tokens, top-p, and frequency/penalty scores to shape output behavior.
- **Analyze output, token usage, and cost** â€“ View side-by-side comparisons of content quality, efficiency, and estimated API costs per model run.
